# squad
A try on the squad dataset. I didn't spend much time on this project because i'm not interested in the specific field
of QA but it was fun to give it a try as a final project of CS224n. The project is really not complete, usually in deep learning projects i setup a lot of visualization graphs to check how the net behave during training and testing. The basic stuff is done using wandb (gradient flow, weights distribution and so on).
